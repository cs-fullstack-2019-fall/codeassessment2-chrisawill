# ### Problem 6
# Create a class called ClubMember 
# Each club member has a name and a role  
# Create ClubMember instances for the following people:
# ```
# Alfred - Club President
# Troy - Club Vice President
# Albert - Club Secretary
# Bob - Club Treasurer
# ```
# Add each member instance to a new club_members list that you create.
# Write the code needed to loop through the club member list and print the current number of members in the list, then the memberâ€™s name and club role, one per line using f strings.

# Example Output:
# ```
# There are currently 4 club members in the list!

# Club President: Alfred
# Club Vice President: Troy
# Club Secretary: Albert
# Club Treasurer: Bob
# ```
